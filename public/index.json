It inspires you, saddens you, enrages you, and fortifies your soul. It is extremely difficult to write with the level of honesty Maya Angelou writes with. She does it for 300 pages straight so every single words of those pages sink into you.\nThe book does not focus on Maya Angelou\u0026rsquo;s life only. It takes the reader through the life of her African-American communities. Also, as she wrote about a very young age she had probably forgotten some details. Hence, the book might seem a bit scattered at times. Though, the extra ground that is covered adds to the book\u0026rsquo;s greatness.\nIt is not a book you could (should) finish at one go. Take time to read it and let the words do their work. You\u0026rsquo;ll love it.\n","date":"4 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review: I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings","type":"posts"},{"content":"The story starts with a fairly used trope: the retiring detective. The extraordinary genius Hercule Poirot is looking to enjoy the quiet life with his contrasting partner Hastings. But their merriment halts abruptly when they meet Nick, a woman who has been through 4 attempted murders.\nPoirot comes out of retirement to protect Nick and untangle the mystery behind the repeated attempts on Nick\u0026rsquo;s life. He works his way through a classic whodunit mystery. We have seen very colorful and interesting characters in the contemporary whodunit mystery movies, but in this novel the characters are fairly ordinary. In fact, the book does not focus much on character development. It focuses on Poirot\u0026rsquo;s methods of deduction and the process of untangling the web.\nThe mystery is tight-knit but the genius of the book is that you could solve it if you pay attention. Many mystery writers often hold out some facts the detective knows until the final reveal. This allows the plot to thicken but it becomes impossible to solve definitively for the readers. Agatha Christie, however, lays out all the facts in snippets during the build-up and Poirot\u0026rsquo;s deductions for the readers without giving the mystery away. This is a rare quality you get to see in only the best mystery books.\nAlthough the mystery is as good as it can be, the book lacks the element of thrill. Deaths and reveals are usually an author\u0026rsquo;s best tools for adding thrill. As the book focuses on meticulous deduction which might be boring at times. So, I would recommend this book only if you are in the mood to challenge your inner detective.\n","date":"4 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/peril-at-end-house/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review: Peril at End House","type":"posts"},{"content":"To Kill a Mockingbird is relevant still, 60 years after its release, and will probably be so for a long time. It might not seem so at first as the story takes place in 1960s rural America and is told in the voice of a young girl in primary school: which might be hard to relate to for some. The core message, however, resonates with all of us who have experienced adulthood.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve done it before, they did it tonight and they\u0026rsquo;ll do it again and when they do it again - seems only children weep\u0026rdquo;- Atticus Finch\nComing of age stories are often based on a grand adventure, but here it was witnessing absurd injustice and racism that drags Scout and Jem into adulthood where numbness starts to take over sorrow and anger. A timeless heartbreaking truth juxtaposed and complemented by the playfulness and innocence of childhood - that\u0026rsquo;s what the book holds in its heart.\nAside from the core message, it is well-written, and funny. The book may seem boring at times, which is only because it might get hard to relate, but the story never gets stale. It talks about complex topics without becoming difficult to follow. The reading difficulty is a bit above average, and the delivery is applicable for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s able to read at that level.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re in the mood for a classic, I will absolutely recommend it.\n","date":"4 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/to-kill-a-mockingbird/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Review: To Kill a Mockingbird","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Table Lamp Writer","summary":"","title":"Table Lamp Writer","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
