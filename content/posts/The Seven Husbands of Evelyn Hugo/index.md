+++
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a book that only gets good after page 359. It ends well and that saves the book from being a total disappointment. Before page 359, the writing is cluttered. Dialogues are often abnormal and the emotions in the scenes are held back by the words. In climactic moments we find dialogue that makes the characters seem devoid of any interest or intrigue at their situation. On the contrary, when conveying philosophical themes, the imagery or the metaphors are often weak, making it seem like the author is trying too hard to make a situation look more profound than it is. Aside from that, there are cluttered sentences, unnecessary detours, and misfitting adjectives. 

The plot is predictable at times but it still holds some intrigue. The bookâ€™s central character, Evelyn Hugo, greatly eclipses the second-most important character Monique, the writer of her biography. Every other character is eclipsed greatly. Characters except Evelyn seem two-dimensional and are not allowed enough room for development.

Nonetheless, the book does greatly improve after page 359. Even if you skim some pages in between you will not Whether any book that blooms after 359 pages is a disappointment.
