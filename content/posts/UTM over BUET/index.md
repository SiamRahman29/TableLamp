## What Happened

In March 2020, the first wave of COVID lockdowns was imposed in Bangladesh, just a month before my higher secondary exams. This delayed the Bangladeshi university entrance exams, which at the time I believed was my only path forward after high school. I was unaware of the opportunities to study abroad, though some of my friends weren’t. Following in their footsteps, I started researching the application process, took the SATs, and sent out applications to about 15 U.S. colleges and a few in Asia.

By March 2021, I had heard back from most of the universities I applied to. Among the many rejections, thankfully, a few acceptances came through. One of them was an offer to study either Physics or Software Engineering at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

UTM had several advantages over the other offers. First, Malaysia was much closer to home than the U.S., which meant I could visit more often. Second, the cost was significantly lower. And finally, UTM had already moved to online classes, allowing me to start right away despite the ongoing lockdown. I began classes at UTM in October 2021.

In the meantime, university entrance exams in Bangladesh were back on the calendar. While brushing up on my school studies, I came across a scholarship offer from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. I applied and, Alhamdulillah, received a fully funded offer to study Physics at the University of Delhi.

So, by the end of 2021, I had three choices:

Study Software Engineering at UTM (where I was already enrolled)

Study Mechanical Engineering at BUET (a dream of both my family and myself)

Study Physics at the University of Delhi (on a full scholarship)

## Eliminating Delhi

Honestly, the offer from Delhi was the easiest to turn down. Although the university was prestigious, I was skeptical about living in Delhi as a Bangladeshi Muslim. It felt risky. My father also wasn’t fond of the idea of me studying Physics, so he quickly supported this decision, and we eliminated Delhi. If only eliminating BUET were that simple.

## Two Boats at Once

Between December 2021 and April 2022, I was undecided. Before sitting for the BUET exam, I had protested to my mother, asking why I had to take such a difficult test if I wasn’t going to attend. But after getting in, the promise and prestige of BUET returned to me. My family was split. Some days I’d wake up sure I was choosing one, only to go to bed sure I was choosing the other.

In February 2022, I began studying online at BUET while continuing my studies at UTM. A part of me had already chosen BUET, and I told myself I was finishing the UTM semester simply because I’d worked hard for it. I communicated this uncertainty to my parents. Surprisingly, my mother—who usually has strong opinions about my choices—was okay with whatever I decided. My father, on the other hand, never explicitly endorsed UTM but kept asking me to think things through. Subtly, he revealed a preference for UTM.

Eventually, in March 2022, while I was exhausted from writing chemistry lab reports for BUET’s "online practical classes", I leaned towards UTM. I had strong reasons both for and against BUET and UTM. So I picked a few good reasons in favor of UTM and told my father I wanted to continue there. He was visibly relieved.

## So Why?

There were no overwhelmingly strong arguments for or against either BUET or UTM. UTM won because my father, whose opinions I trust, had a clear preference, and the part of me that felt confident was indifferent: an indifference that came from a belief that I would do well wherever I went, and that I wouldn’t really miss anything.

My research came from websites, other people’s stories, and my own experiences studying online at both places. From what I could tell, I wasn’t losing much either way. So in the month of October 2022, I flew off to Kuala Lumpur.
