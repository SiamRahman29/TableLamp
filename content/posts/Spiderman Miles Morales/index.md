## The Game

*Spider-Man: Miles Morales* is the second Spider-Man game from Insomniac Games. It follows the story of—yep, you guessed it—**Miles Morales**, as he begins his own journey as Spider-Man.

The game opens with Miles working as Peter Parker’s sidekick, but that’s only during the first mission. After that, you play exclusively as Miles, while Peter is off on vacation. Though it’s Miles’ first time being the one and only Spider-Man, he doesn’t have time to take things slow. A new gang equipped with next-gen tech called **The Underground** has emerged. They're targeting **Roxxon**, the largest energy corporation in the world.

The story centers around Miles trying to stop the conflict between Roxxon and the Underground before it tears his neighborhood—**Harlem**—apart.

## The Pros

This game improves on *Marvel’s Spider-Man* in multiple ways:

- **Traversal** is smooth, fast, and incredibly fun. Swinging through the city as Miles never gets old.
- **Combat** is exciting and dynamic. You get to use Miles’ signature powers like venom strikes and invisibility, which add variety and depth to the fights.
- There’s **room for creativity**—the combination of gadgets, powers, and stealth offers multiple approaches to combat.
- **Customization** is solid. You can equip different mods to match your play style.
- A wide variety of **unlockable suits** gives you extra motivation to complete side quests. I normally skip side content, but here, the rewards made it worth the effort.

Another standout feature is the **diversity**. Inclusion isn’t just an afterthought or marketing gimmick—it’s part of the story and setting. The game does a great job authentically portraying Harlem’s cultural richness without feeling forced or “preachy.”

## The Cons

No game is perfect. Here’s where *Miles Morales* falls short:

- **The story is too shallow**. The focus is on Miles’ own rogues’ gallery rather than Peter’s well-known villains, which makes sense—but unfortunately, the villains feel underdeveloped. I never felt fully invested in the stakes.
- **Too short**. The main campaign doesn’t offer much in terms of twists or surprises, and it wraps up quickly.
- **Repetitive side quests**. Many side missions boil down to fighting similar enemies over and over.
- **Underwhelming stealth**. Stealth mechanics feel basic. Enemies often behave unrealistically and don’t react smartly when you’re nearby.

## The Verdict

### What I Loved:
1. ⚔️ Combat  
2. 🌆 Traversal  
3. 🕶️ Suit designs and customization  

### What Fell Short:
1. 🧩 Story depth  
2. 🕵️ Stealth mechanics  

**Final Thoughts:**  
I’d absolutely play another Spider-Man game. *Miles Morales* was a fun experience with solid mechanics, but the short and underwhelming story left me wanting more.

# **Score: 8/10**
