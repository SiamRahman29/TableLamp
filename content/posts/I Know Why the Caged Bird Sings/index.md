"At fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender in its place  was as honorable as resistance, especially if one had no choice."

I  Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is Maya Angelou's journey from 3-16. It  inspires you, saddens you, enrages you, and fortifies your soul. It is  extremely difficult to write with the level of honesty Maya Angelou  writes with. She does it for 300 pages straight so every single words of  those pages sink into you. 

The book does not focus on Maya  Angelou's life only. It takes the reader through the soul of her communities. Also, as she wrote about a very young age, she had probably forgotten some details. Hence, the book might seem a  bit scattered at times. Though, the extra ground that is covered adds to  the book's greatness.

It is not a book you could (should) finish at one go. Take time to read it and let the words do their work. You'll love it.
