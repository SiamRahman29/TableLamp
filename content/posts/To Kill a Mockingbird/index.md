To Kill a Mockingbird is relevant still, 60 years after its release, and will probably be so for a long time. It might not seem so at first as the story takes place in 1960s rural America and is told in the voice of a young girl in primary school: which might be hard to relate to for some. The core message, however, resonates with all of us who have experienced adulthood.

Coming of age stories are often based on a grand adventure, but here it was witnessing absurd injustice and racism that drags Scout and Jem into adulthood where numbness starts to take over sorrow and anger. A timeless heartbreaking truth juxtaposed and complemented by the playfulness and innocence of childhood - that's what the book holds in its heart.

Aside from the core message, it is well-written, and funny. The book may seem boring at times, which is only because it might get hard to relate, but the story never gets stale. It talks about complex topics without becoming difficult to follow. The reading difficulty is a bit above average, and the delivery is applicable for anyone who's able to read at that level.

If you're in the mood for a classic, I will absolutely recommend it.
