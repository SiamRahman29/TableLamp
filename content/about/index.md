Welcome to my blog site. This is a place where I write about my thoughts, learnings, and opinions. Writing here soothes me by giving my thoughts a place to rest, and allows me to grow as a writer.

But who am I?

I'm a final year Software Engineering major from Bangladesh. I work at an AI startup based in California, but I live in Bangladesh. I like to read, write, play games, play football, and listen to Radiolab. I am naturally an introvert, but I can channel extrovert energy on command. My favorite movie is Interstellar, my favorite books is We Have No Idea by George Cham and Daniel Whiteson.

It has not been long since I started writing. I wrote my first story in the 9th grade and have been writing in my notebook one-and-off since. Eventually, I realized that my writings would never have any impact if no one ever read them (shocker), so I went beyond the notebook and started a blog. I tried multiple builders but settled on building one myself with Hugo (framework, not a person). Now here we are!
